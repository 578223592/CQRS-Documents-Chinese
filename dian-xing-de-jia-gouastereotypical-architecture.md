# 典型的架构（A Stereotypical Architecture ）

Before moving into architectures for Domain Driven Design based projects it is important to start off by\
analyzing what is generally considered to be the standard architecture that many try to apply to\

rational steps while trying to minimize the cost in terms of productivity for each step towards a better\
architecture.
